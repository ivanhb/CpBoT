I am using telepot: a library which builds applications for Telegram Bot API. 
The current version of CpBoT can integrate any any number of new module defined adhoc. Each module can define several commands which will be handled by the Bot. 

## Getting started
1) Change the value of the variables ```TOKEN``` and ```BOTNAME``` in the file **main.py** with the credentials of your telegram bot.

2) Define your own .py modules and add them into the directory **modules/**. Use the current modules as an example and the **guide.py** as a file guideline to build your own modules.

3) Run the main file:
```python main.py```
